CS579 Database Management, TEAM 3 project

**IMPORTANT**
Hello whoever reading this README,

Here's TEAM3. We are glad to sent our 2020 Spring semester database course project files to you.
PPT file attached with audios inside, please click the icon of the audio on each page for our presetation listening.
Our project is using PostgreSQL to storage our data and pgadmin v4 to manage. 
However, pgadmin v4 may not be necessary for you if you do not need a GUI tool.

Sincerely,
Team3 members
